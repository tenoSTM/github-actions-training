# GitHub Actions Intermediate Training

## The primary audience of this document is:
- ðŸ‘¥ DevOps Engineers with Intermediate knowledge of GitHub Actions

## Milestones

These milestones represent the key tasks to complete for a successful training delivery. They ensure that the participants gain practical experience and a deeper understanding of GitHub Actions:

- [ ] Review advanced workflow components like matrix builds, concurrency, and conditional statements
- [ ] Understand reusable workflows, including composite actions and JavaScript/Docker-based actions
- [ ] Create and test workflows locally using the `act` tool
- [ ] Automate manual tasks within GitHub environments using Actions
- [ ] Secure workflows with proper permissions, secrets, and environments
- [ ] Understand advanced CI/CD best practices with GitHub Actions, including scaling and monitoring runners
- [ ] Complete exercises that demonstrate key concepts

Attendees are expected to have followed the [GitHub Actions Fundamentals training](https://github.com/services/actions-training) or at least have the expected related skills.

For this training, which is partially lab-based (hands-on), we will use a public account on GitHub.com (no EMU, no GHES). We do this for a few reasons:

We don't want you to "practice" in repositories that contain real code.
We are going to break some things, so we can teach you how to fix them (therefore, refer to the line above).

You can set up your free account by following these steps:

* Access [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and click sign up
* Choose the free account
* You will receive a verification email at the address provided
* Click the link to complete the verification process
* If you already have an account, verify that you can visit github.com within your organization's network.
